# zalt-html
Zalt html is a PHP library for easy Html use and creation, with minimal dependencies on external libraries.

The library consist of three sub-packages:

1. **Html** The (main) Zalt-Html code makes it easy to generate HTML output using objects.
2. **Late** Objects that allow setting e.g. HTML attributes like colspan while the number of columns is not yet known.
3. **Snippets** Objects that combine HTML generation with business logic code and limited routing.

## Html

## Late

The Late package is a package for defining code that will be evaluated at a later stage of code execution, usually when 
rendering the actual Html objects for output.
